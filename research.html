	<h2>Descartes's Rule of Signs</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Take a polynomial with real or rational coefficients such as $x^6 + x^3 - 5x^2 + 1$.
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Count the number of times the coefficients change signs from positive to negative or vice versa (ignoring any $0$ coefficients).
			</p>
			<p>
				Here we change signs once from $x^3$ to $-5x^2$ and a second time from $-5x^2$ to $+1$.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Descartes's Rule says that the number of positive solutions of the polynomial, i.e. of $x^6 + x^3 - 5x^2 + 1 = 0$ is no more than this count of sign changes.</p>
			<p>The number of positive roots might be less than this count if some of the roots are non-real.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The Arithmetic of Signs</h2>
	<p>
		Through primary and secondary education, one learns how to add, subtract, multiply and divide rational and decimal numbers.
		Instead, suppose we forget everything about our numbers except whether they are positive, negative or zero and try to do similar arithmetic there.
	</p>
	<p>
		So now are arithmetic consists of rules like: positive + positive = positive or negative ÷ negative = positive. This arithmetic is pretty straightforward to use except for the rule which says that a positive plus a negative number may be any sort of number.
	</p>
	<p>
		Arithmetics like these are called <b>hyperfields</b>. In a hyperfield, we can add, subtract, multiply and divide, except addition and subtraction may produce a set of posibilities rather than a unique outcome.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Polynomials over Hyperfields</h2>
	<p>
		My PhD advisor, together with Oliver Lorscheid, showed that Descartes's Rule is a natural consequence of considering polynomials in the arithmetic of signs. I.e. instead of a polynomial with integer or rational coefficients, the coefficients are either "positive," "negative" or "zero." Instead of asking "is 2 a root? and with what multiplicity?" we ask "is 'positive' a root? and with what multiplicity?"
	</p>
	<p>
		My work extends their work in two ways. In one paper, I extend their work to a broader class of arithmetics. In a second paper, with Andreas Gross, we extend their ideas to polynomials in more than one variable.
	</p>

	<h2>Tropical Geometry and Valued Fields</h2>
	<p>
		A sign is not the only information that a rational number has, it also has an absolute value. More than that, if $p$ is a prime number ($2, 3, 5, 7, \dots$) then a rational number has a count of how many factors of $p$ it has. Factors appearing in the denominator are counted negatively. This count is denoted $v_p(x)$.
	</p>
	<p>
		For instance, $24/5 = 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^{-1}$. So we say that $v_2(24/5) = 3, v_3(24/5) = 1$ and $v_5(24/5) = -1$.
		We can also extend this to algebraic numbers like square roots or cube roots. For instance, $v_5(5^{1/3}) = \frac13$.
	</p>
	<p>
		An arithmetic like the rational numbers, together with a prime-factor-counting operator like $v_5$, is called a <b>valued field</b> and the operator, $v_5$, is called a <b>valuation</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Take a curve or surface defined by an algebraic equation, such as the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Look at not just the rational solutions but also the algebraic solutions. For instance, $(x, y) = (\frac15, \frac{\sqrt{24}}5)$. Consider $(v_5(x), v_5(y))$ for each algebraic solution. Here $v_5(\frac15) = -1$ and $v_5(\frac{\sqrt{24}}5) = -1$.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turns out that the valuations for this circle are one of three kinds:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>$(a, a)$ for $a \le 0$</li>
		<li>$(a, 0)$ for $a \ge 0$</li>
		<li>$(0, a)$ for $a \ge 0$</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		<b>Algebraic geometry</b> is the study of these curves and surfaces defined by algebraic equations. <b>Tropical geometry</b> is the study of these <i>tropical</i> curves which are a collection of lines, rays, line segments (and the equivalent for surfaces) that arise from this process of looking at valuations.

	<h2>Resources</h2>
	<h3>Tropical Geometry</h3>
	<p>For a quick explanation of tropical geometry, Madeline Brandt has an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYqGanjjUdQ">8 minute video explanation</a> on YouTube. For a longer, but still quite approachable, introduction to tropical geometry, I recommend <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07012">this survey article</a> by Ralph Morrison. For higher level general treatments of the subject, here are some books:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-161/">Introduction to Tropical Geometry</a></i> by Diane Maclagan and Bernd Sturmfels</li>
		<li><i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-219/">Essentials of Tropical Combinatorics</a></i> by Michael Joswig</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Hyperfields</h3>
	<p>For learning about hyperfields and multiplicities for polynomials over hyperfields, the original article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04966"><i>Descartes' rule of signs, Newton polygons, and polynomials over hyperfields</i></a> by my PhD advisor, Matt Baker, and Oliver Lorscheid should be accessible to anyone with some familiarity with abstract algebra and mathematical maturity.</p>
	<h3>Ordered Blueprints</h3>
	<p>Oliver Lorscheid naturally has several papers describing ordered blueprints. For a starting point, I recommend looking at his <a href="https://oliver.impa.br/notes/2018-Blueprints/lecturenotes.php">lecture notes</a>. I strongly suggest having good familiarity with commutative algebra and some category theory for these.</p>
