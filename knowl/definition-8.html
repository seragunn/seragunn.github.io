<p>A <em class="emphasis">metric graph</em> <span class="process-math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a graph in the combinatorial sense (multiple edges and loops are allowed) but modelled as a metric space by giving each edge <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> a positive length <span class="process-math">\(\ell(e) \in (0, \infty]\text{,}\)</span> possibly restricted to some subgroup like <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{.}\)</span> In this way, we make each edge isometric to the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,\ell(e)]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Sometimes, we will ask that the only vertices we consider are the ones that are required topologically. I.e. the ones of degree different from 2 since two edges meeting at a single vertex can just be joined up and their lengths added. Vertices of degree 2 will come and go as needed. The last requirement is that only leaf edges are allowed to be infinite and conversely, every leaf edge is required to be infinite.</p>
<p>We call the underlying combinatorial graph <span class="process-math">\(|\Gamma|\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-tropical.html#definition-8">in-context</a></span>
