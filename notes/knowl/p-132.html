<p>The reason why this self-intersection number is what it is is because the total degree needs to be <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> Many self-intersection problems are computed this way. For instance, in the plane, two lines intersect in a single point. So <span class="process-math">\(\ell \cdot \ell = 1\text{.}\)</span> But now if we blow up the point of intersection, the class <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> becomes <span class="process-math">\(\ell + E\)</span>â€”an exceptional divisor. And here we still have <span class="process-math">\((\ell + E)(\ell + E) = 1\)</span> except now <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> do not intersect but <span class="process-math">\(\ell \cdot E = 1\)</span> and in order to make the equation come out right, <span class="process-math">\(E \cdot E = -1\text{.}\)</span></p>
