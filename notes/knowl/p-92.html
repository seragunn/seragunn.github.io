<p>Sometimes, we will ask that the only vertices we consider are the ones that are required topologically. I.e. the ones of degree different from 2 since two edges meeting at a single vertex can just be joined up and their lengths added. Vertices of degree 2 will come and go as needed. The last requirement is that only leaf edges are allowed to be infinite and conversely, every leaf edge is required to be infinite.</p>
