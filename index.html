	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I am a sixth year PhD student at Georgia Tech. I am interested in algebraic combinatorics and combinatorial algebraic geometry. Right now I am studying how to factor polynomials over hyperfields with an aim of developing a theory of intersection multiplicities. Previous to that, I studied divisor theory on abstract tropical curves with application to faithful tropicalization.</p>
	<p>My advisor is <a class="person" href="https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home">Matt Baker</a>.</p>
	<p>I received my BMath from the University of Waterloo with majors in Pure Mathematics and Combinatorics &amp; Optimization.</p>

	<h2>High School Math Day</h2>
	<p>
		Together with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wadebloomquist" class="person">Wade Bloomquist</a> and <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~e2smithr" class="person">Evelyne Smith-Roberge</a>, we are reshaping the old High School Math Competition to appeal to a broader audience. The new event will feature:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Board games and other fun investigative math activities (e.g. soap films)</li>
		<li>A new logic based competition track focusing on more puzzle based math rather than algebra or geometry</li>
		<li>Prizes for new competitors and creative solutions to open ended problems</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		More details coming soon! <a href="https://hsmc.gatech.edu/">https://hsmc.gatech.edu/</a>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 0">Algebraic Student Seminar:</h3>
			<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ga-sas">https://sites.google.com/view/ga-sas</a></p>
			<p>I organize the Algebra Student Seminar at Georgia Tech together with <a href="https://kevinshu.me/" class="person">Kevin Shu</a>.
				Previously with Cvetelina Hill, Marc Härkönen and Jaewoo Jung
				The seminar is intended for graduate students to talk about their research or present on topics they are interested in learning about.</p>

		<li>
			<h3>Graduate Student Colloquium:</h3>
			<p>I organize the Graduate Student Colloquium together with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/abhishekdhawan/" class="person">Abhishek Dhawan</a> and <a href="https://shapirorh.wixsite.com/rshapiromath" class="person">Roberta Shapiro</a>.</p>
			<p>Currently the colloquia meet before other School of Math social events such as board game nights.</p>
			<p>The colloquium is looking for speakers! Please reach out to one of us if you are interested in giving a talk.</p>

	<h2>Resources</h2>
	<h3>Tropical Geometry</h3>
	<p>For a quick explanation of tropical geometry, Madeline Brandt has an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYqGanjjUdQ">8 minute video explanation</a> on YouTube. For a longer, but still quite approachable, introduction to tropical geometry, I recommend <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07012">this survey article</a> by Ralph Morrison. For higher level general treatments of the subject, here are some books:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-161/">Introduction to Tropical Geometry</a></i> by Diane Maclagan and Bernd Sturmfels</li>
		<li><i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-219/">Essentials of Tropical Combinatorics</a></i> by Michael Joswig</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Hyperfields</h3>
	<p>For learning about hyperfields and multiplicities for polynomials over hyperfields, the original article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04966"><i>Descartes' rule of signs, Newton polygons, and polynomials over hyperfields</i></a> by my advisor, Matt Baker, and Oliver Lorscheid should be accessible to anyone with some familiarity with abstract algebra and mathematical maturity.</p>
	<h3>Ordered Blueprints</h3>
	<p>Oliver Lorscheid naturally has several papers describing ordered blueprints. For a starting point, I recommend looking at his <a href="https://oliver.impa.br/notes/2018-Blueprints/lecturenotes.php">lecture notes</a>. I strongly suggest having good familiarity with commutative algebra and some category theory for these.</p>
