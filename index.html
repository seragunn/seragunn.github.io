	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I am a lecturer of mathematics at the College of Staten Island, City University of New York (CUNY).</p>
	<p>I received my PhD at Georgia Tech under the supervision of <a class="person" href="https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home">Matt Baker</a>		
	My doctoral research was in tropical and non-Archimedean geometry. Specifically, I looked at multiplicities and factorizations of polynomials over hyperfields with an aim of developing a theory of intersection multiplicities.
	I also looked at the question of finding fully-faithful tropical curves in three dimensions using tropical divisor theory on curves.</p>
	<p>I received my BMath from the University of Waterloo with majors in Pure Mathematics and Combinatorics &amp; Optimization.</p>

	<h2>High School Math Day</h2>
	<p>
		Together with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wadebloomquist" class="person">Wade Bloomquist</a> and <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~e2smithr" class="person">Evelyne Smith-Roberge</a>, I helped broaden the scope and appeal of the old High School Math Competition. The new <i>High School Math Day</i> event featured:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Board games and other fun investigative math activities</li>
		<li>A new logic based competition track focusing on more puzzle based math rather than algebra or geometry</li>
		<li>Prizes for new competitors and creative solutions to open ended problems</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The home page for the HSMD is <a href="https://hsmd.math.gatech.edu/">https://hsmd.math.gatech.edu</a>. Our event was also covered in <a href="https://cos.gatech.edu/news/reimagining-high-school-math-day-and-multiplying-fun">the College of Sciences news</a>!

	<h2>Resources</h2>
	<h3>Tropical Geometry</h3>
	<p>For a quick explanation of tropical geometry, Madeline Brandt has an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYqGanjjUdQ">8 minute video explanation</a> on YouTube. For a longer, but still quite approachable, introduction to tropical geometry, I recommend <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07012">this survey article</a> by Ralph Morrison. For higher level general treatments of the subject, here are some books:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-161/">Introduction to Tropical Geometry</a></i> by Diane Maclagan and Bernd Sturmfels</li>
		<li><i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-219/">Essentials of Tropical Combinatorics</a></i> by Michael Joswig</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Hyperfields</h3>
	<p>For learning about hyperfields and multiplicities for polynomials over hyperfields, the original article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04966"><i>Descartes' rule of signs, Newton polygons, and polynomials over hyperfields</i></a> by my advisor, Matt Baker, and Oliver Lorscheid should be accessible to anyone with some familiarity with abstract algebra and mathematical maturity.</p>
	<h3>Ordered Blueprints</h3>
	<p>Oliver Lorscheid naturally has several papers describing ordered blueprints. For a starting point, I recommend looking at his <a href="https://oliver.impa.br/notes/2018-Blueprints/lecturenotes.php">lecture notes</a>. I strongly suggest having good familiarity with commutative algebra and some category theory for these.</p>
